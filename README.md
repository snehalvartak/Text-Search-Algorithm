where q is the user query, doc is the target (candidate document in AP89), t is the query term, c(t,doc) is the count of term t in document doc, N is total number of documents in AP89, and k(t) is the total number of documents that have the term t. Please use Lucene API to get the information. From retrieval viewpoint, (c(t,doc))/(length(doc)) is called normalized TF (term frequency), while log‚Å°(1+N/k(t) ) is IDF (inverse document frequency).
